    My Passion for Design and Development
    </h1>
<br/>
From a young age, I was always intrigued by how things worked, which led me to explore the world of technology. While my academic focus is in AIML, my true passion lies in the creative aspect of technology—designing. I find immense satisfaction in crafting beautiful, intuitive, and functional digital experiences. This passion has naturally evolved into a strong interest and skill set in Full Stack Web Development, where I have the opportunity to bring my creative ideas to life on the web.

    My Skills and Experience
    </h1>
<br/>
As a full-stack web developer, I have hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end technologies. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js. I’ve worked on several projects where I was responsible for designing user-friendly interfaces as well as developing robust back-end systems.

Alongside web development, I’m diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, constantly learning and exploring new concepts. This combination of design, development, and AI/ML makes me uniquely positioned to work on projects that are both innovative and functional.
